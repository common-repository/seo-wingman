== Description ==

SEO Wingman™ is an integrated tool that allows our experts to assist you in improving and maintaining your site’s search engine optimization. It’s great for both web professionals and small business owners because it offloads the tedious, time consuming part of SEO and lets you focus on what you do best.

SEO Wingman is backed by two expert companies in the digital field. Mediaura, a full service digital agency with a rich history in marketing and advertising, and 'corePHP', a high-end software development firm and the developers of paGO Commerce.

Together, we bring a solution that will have a positive impact on your ROI.

If you are doing business online, your customers need to be able to find you. This becomes increasingly more important for e-commerce websites, where the conversion is an actual transaction. SEO Wingman will help improve your search ranking so that more customers will find your website and ultimately purchase your products.

The “build it and they will come” approach simply does not work for the modern web, and that’s why we are here to help.
